This is a script made to wipe the contents of 16 flash drives with drive letters F through U and copy down all the contents of C:\Geo\Teen Challenge\Marketing\50Th Anniversary\USB Master Image folder
The Powershell scripts are basically just there so I can edit the script in the future if need be. 
The executables are to keep you from having to change the powershell Execution policy. 
If this doesn't work you may have to run as administrator, but it worked fine from mine without.
